# Contributing

There are a few steps to take to contribute to Glimbot.

1. Create an issue or file a bug describing the contribution you want to make or want fixed, if it doesn't already exist. 
The more info is in that filing, the quicker your request can be approved or denied.
2. Wait for the issue to be approved and/or to be assigned to the issue, if you are a contributor.
3. If you are a contributor, create a branch with your username and a description of the issue you're fixing, e.g. `nisamson/impl-config-module`.
Otherwise, fork the project and create a branch thusly named.
4. Submit your code for code review. Your code needs to build and ideally have been tested with a real bot token on Discord to be accepted.

When you submit code to the code base, you will need to agree to assign the copyright for your contribution to me, Nicholas Samson. If you are engaged in work-for-hire,
your employer will need to provide a disclaimer on copyright for code you submit to the code base.
