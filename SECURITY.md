# Security Reporting

**DO NOT** report vulnerabilities in Glimbot through GitHub issues. The only case for which there is an exception is
for already publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Glimbot dependencies; these may be reported as bugs.

If you discover a security issue in Glimbot, please send an email to one of the repo admins.

Please include, to the degree possible,
- what version of Glimbot the issue occurs in
- what steps are needed to reproduce or exploit the issue
- any system configuration issues that contributed to the issue

If we decide to open a GitHub Security Advisory, you will be credited for any contributions you make
to the discovery and/or eventual fix of the issue. Please avoid publicly disclosing the issue until
this advisory is made public.

## Support

Glimbot support will only target the most recent versions of the bot. However, the project
will accept PRs to backport fixes for major issues, including any security issues.
